      <h2>Chapter One: Invisable</h2>
      <p>Ethan Gray preferred the edges of things. The edges of rooms, the edges of conversations, the edges of the lunchroom where the flickering overhead lights didn’t reach. He moved through life like a shadow in too much daylight—too quiet to notice, too strange to fully ignore.
It was early autumn, and the leaves had begun their slow, rattling descent. The school bell had rung thirty minutes ago, but Ethan wasn’t in a hurry to get home. He didn’t like being in a hurry. Hurrying attracted attention, and attention rarely meant anything good.
He walked the long way back, past the overgrown soccer field, through the crooked chain-link fence, and into the woods behind the neighborhood. This trail wasn’t official—just a dirt-worn path pressed into the earth by years of skipping students, cigarette-smoking loners, and now, Ethan.
The woods welcomed him in a way nothing else did. No judgment, no smirks. Just the whisper of branches and the crunch of leaves underfoot.
A loud caw echoed above.
He looked up.
There they were.
A cluster of crows—eight, maybe ten—perched in the skeletal arms of a gnarled maple. One turned its head, regarding him with obsidian eyes.
“Hey,” Ethan said quietly, as if it were normal to greet birds. Maybe for him it was.
He reached into the canvas bag slung over his shoulder and pulled out a slice of bread he’d swiped from the cafeteria. He tore it into chunks and scattered it near the base of the tree. The crows didn’t dive right away. They never did. First they watched. Always watched.
He stood still, hands buried in his hoodie pocket, and waited.
One bird finally dropped, wings fanning out like black sails. It pecked at a crust, looked up at him, then back down. A few others followed.
The largest crow, with a single silver feather near its wing joint, didn’t move. It stayed above, staring. That one had been here the past four days—always perched alone. Always watching.
Ethan didn’t name things, not usually. But he’d started thinking of that one as Sentinel.
He sat on a low boulder and took out his sketchbook. The corners were bent, the spiral binding warped from rain. He didn’t draw people. Not anymore. But birds—especially crows—he understood them.
Crows didn’t mock. They didn’t laugh at your clothes or talk behind your back. They didn’t care that your voice cracked when you got nervous, or that you froze up when someone made eye contact for too long.
He sketched quickly—sharp beaks, sweeping wings, scratchy texture on the silver-feathered one’s crown. The pencil lead smudged under his fingers, but he didn’t mind.
In the distance, he heard the faint echo of laughter. Teenager laughter. High, fake, and cruel.
He tensed.
Probably Chase and Tyler again. Maybe Mason. Always hanging out near the back lot after school, smoking and waiting for someone to harass.
Ethan closed the sketchbook and stood. His breath caught in his throat as he heard the crunch of leaves from the other direction—just a squirrel. He exhaled.
The crows were finishing the bread. One hopped closer than usual, pausing just five feet from him. It tilted its head, blinked once, then flew off.
The others followed, scattering into the sky like a shadow breaking apart.
Only the silver-feathered one remained. Sentinel.
It let out one long, low caw before gliding off silently into the trees.
Ethan stood there for a while longer, until the woods were quiet again. No birds. No laughter. Just him and the fading warmth of a short autumn sun.
He walked home slowly.
The house smelled like burnt coffee and detergent. His dad was asleep on the couch, TV on but muted. A half-eaten frozen dinner sat on the coffee table. The blinds were closed.
Ethan climbed the stairs, stepped into his room, and locked the door.
He opened the sketchbook again, flipping past dozens of black ink birds until he found the new page. The last crow he’d drawn—the one with the silver feather—stared back at him from the paper, wings stretched, mid-leap.
He shaded the eyes darker, then darker again. Until they were just circles of void.
He didn’t know why, but he whispered to the drawing:
“Thanks for not flying away.”
</p>

    <div class="chapter">
      <h2>Chapter Two: The Joke</h2>
      <p>By second period the next morning, Ethan had already been called “bird freak,” “Silent Gray,” and “Edgar Allen No.” That last one was new—credit to Tyler, who seemed proud of it.
The classrooms smelled like marker ink and floor cleaner, and the building was either freezing cold or smotheringly hot depending on where you sat. Ethan tried to take comfort in routine. He always picked the back-right desk. He always folded his hands after taking out his notebook. He always looked out the window during roll call.
The crows weren’t out there today. Just clouds and the dead outline of the flagpole.
A paper ball bounced off the top of his head.
He flinched and heard the snickering. He didn’t look around.
“Did you finish your ritual, Crowboy?” Chase hissed a couple desks away, barely audible.
He’d made the mistake of sketching during lunch one day a few weeks ago. They’d seen it—the black wings, the clustered beaks, the glossy eyes. That was all it took.
He clenched his jaw and kept his eyes down.
It was in the hallway after third period when things got worse.
Ethan had been walking with his head down, lost in thought, rehearsing what he might say to Haley. Nothing big. Just “Hey,” maybe, or a comment about the book she was reading—he’d seen it, To Kill a Mockingbird. Classic.
He could say, “That one’s good. Sad, though.”
Something normal. Something human.
He was playing the words over in his head when someone shouldered him hard into a locker. His shoulder slammed against the cold metal, the sound too loud in the crowded hallway.
“Watch it, pigeon boy,” Tyler said, grinning. Chase was next to him, pretending to flap his arms like wings.
Ethan caught a glimpse of Haley down the hall—she hadn’t seen. She was talking to a girl in a denim jacket, smiling, unaware.
Chase made a cooing noise. “Maybe he’s trying to impress his girlfriend. Hey Gray, you writing her poetry in bird seed?”
Heat crawled up Ethan’s neck.
He reached for his bag, but it had already been grabbed and thrown halfway down the hallway. Books spilled out, his sketchbook landing face-down, pages fluttering like wings. Students stepped around it. Some stepped on it.
Laughter. Not loud. Just… there. In the background of shuffling students.
Ethan moved like sleepwalking, gathering his things, not saying a word. His math notes were crumpled and wet—someone had dropped their Gatorade. His sketchbook had a footprint on the cover.
He didn’t even look at the bullies.
He just stuffed everything back into his bag and walked.

He skipped lunch and went to the courtyard, where a few pigeons pecked near the benches. He sat alone and pulled out a half-smashed peanut butter sandwich. Didn’t eat it—just stared at it.
“Hey.”
Ethan looked up. Malik, the quiet kid from his science class, stood nearby holding a tray. Glasses, frizzy hair, headphones around his neck.
He offered Ethan a folded napkin.
“There’s jelly on your hoodie,” Malik said simply. Then he sat on the opposite end of the bench, didn’t say anything else.
Ethan wiped his sleeve and mumbled, “Thanks.”
Malik didn’t press. He just sat and ate his pasta, quietly, like he was used to silence. It was the first time in a long time someone had sat next to Ethan without laughing at him.
He didn’t know what to say, so he said nothing. But when the bell rang, he found himself wanting to.

That afternoon, Ethan walked his usual route home through the woods.
His sketchbook stayed zipped in his bag, but the memory of students crushing it underfoot burned hot in his chest.
He imagined them stepping on a crow. Just once.
How would a murder react?
He let the thought drift, half-sick with guilt for even imagining it. But it lingered.
As he neared the clearing, he whistled softly. No real tune. Just instinct.
A few crows responded—sharp, echoing caws.
He smiled a little. Not because they answered, but because it meant they were still here.
Still watching.
</p>

<div class="chapter">
      <h2>Chapter Three: Broken</h2>
      <p>The rain came fast that night.
It wasn’t a dramatic storm. No thunder, no lightning—just a steady, soaking kind of rain that turned leaves soggy and streets reflective. Ethan liked walking in the rain. It gave him a reason not to look at people.
He took the longer trail again, winding through the wet woods behind the neighborhood, crunching across gravel and roots slick with moss. He was almost at the clearing when he heard it.
A sound that didn’t belong.
A frantic rustling. Then—a harsh, wet caw, cut short.
Ethan froze.
He scanned the tree line, then the underbrush.
There—beneath a bramble of thorns and brush—was a mass of feathers jerking against a snare of wire and broken plastic. A crow, struggling. One wing was splayed unnaturally, the feathers bent and out of place.
Another rough caw. Then silence.
Ethan’s first instinct was to step back. His stomach twisted. It was disturbing. Too real.
But he didn’t move.
The bird’s black eye rolled toward him, blinking slowly. Its beak opened, but no sound came out this time.
Ethan dropped his backpack and crouched low, reaching carefully into the mess. “Hey… hey, I got you,” he whispered, more to himself than the bird.
The wire was twisted with some fishing line and what looked like a plastic six-pack ring. Ethan used the key from his house keychain to saw at the strands, working slowly. The crow flinched, but didn’t peck. It was exhausted. Trembling.
After several minutes, the mess gave way.
He gently scooped the bird into his hoodie, wrapping it like a loose sling. Its head rested against his chest, feathers wet and mangled.
Ethan walked the rest of the way home without noticing the rain anymore.
He cleaned out the old garden shed behind the house—mostly unused now except for broken tools and a rusted lawnmower. He laid down a towel, made a makeshift perch out of a broomstick across two chairs, and lined the corner with an old milk crate and blanket.
The bird didn’t fight. Just watched him.
Its right wing hung low, clearly injured.
“I’ll fix it,” Ethan said, unsure of how or what he meant.
That night, he sat at his desk long after midnight, hoodie still damp, browser tabs filling the screen.
Searches like:
"How to care for injured crow?"
"Do crows feel pain?"
"Feeding wild birds after trauma"
"Signs of broken wing in corvids"
He jotted notes on napkins and receipt backs. Most guides said to call a wildlife rehab center. But what if they took the bird away? What if they killed it?
No. This one was different. He knew it.
He flipped to another article—this one about crow intelligence. It talked about how crows remember faces, hold grudges, and teach lessons to each other. He leaned closer.
“Crows communicate through complex calls to warn of predators, share food locations, and rally groups. Certain calls appear to function as 'words' within their social groups. Some humans have learned to mimic basic food or alert calls, building trust over time.”
Ethan reread the last part three times.
Calls that meant food. Calls that meant danger. Calls that brought others.
He copied a few links and video recordings of crow calls to his phone. He didn’t know why. Just that it felt important.
He played a short clip of a feeding call. It was short and musical—like a laugh cut off.
He glanced toward the shed through the window. Rain still traced slow rivers down the glass.
“Smart bird,” he murmured.
I think I will name you Poe he claimed to himself before falling asleep.
At school the next day, Ethan could barely keep his eyes open.
He sat in his usual spot during Mr. Hart’s Literature class, blinking hard at the blurry projector. They were reading Frankenstein. Most kids didn’t care.
Mr. Hart was mid-sentence about “the creature’s longing for belonging” when he paused.
“Ethan,” he said. Not unkindly. “Would you care to weigh in?”
Ethan blinked. The room turned its eyes to him like searchlights.
He opened his mouth, then closed it.
Mr. Hart let the silence sit for just a moment. “Or perhaps… you’ve got a more artistic version of the creature in your sketchbook?”
That drew a few snickers.
Ethan stiffened.
Mr. Hart’s voice didn’t change, but his gaze was steady. “That wasn’t sarcasm. I’ve seen you drawing. You’ve got something real in there.”
Ethan blinked again. “Um. Thanks.”
Mr. Hart gave a small nod. “Any time.”
After class, while everyone else rushed out, Mr. Hart caught up to him.
“You’ve got a good eye,” he said, gesturing to the notebook tucked under Ethan’s arm. “Ever thought of joining the art club?”
Ethan shook his head. “I don’t really... do people.”
Mr. Hart smiled. “Art doesn’t need a crowd. Sometimes it just needs a place to land.”
Ethan didn’t know how to respond to that, so he just gave the tiniest shrug.
“If you ever want to talk,” Mr. Hart added, “even if it’s just about pens or poetry, I’m around.”
It wasn’t much. But it was more than Ethan had heard from any adult in a long time.

That afternoon, he checked on Poe.
The crow hadn’t moved much, but it had eaten some of the scrambled egg he’d left. When Ethan entered the shed, Poe lifted his head.
“Still alive,” Ethan said quietly, and crouched next to him. “Still watching me, huh?”
He held out a shallow cup of water.
Poe took a few sips.
Ethan watched him longer than he realized. The bird’s dark eye reflected back not just the light—but Ethan himself. Small, gray, hunched. But there.
He sat back against the wall, hoodie damp with the smell of old dust and feathers.
“Guess we’re both kind of broken.”
The crow didn’t answer. But it didn’t look away, either.

    <div class="chapter">
      <h2>Chapter Four: Tried and Failed</h2>
      <p>Ethan had spent four days rehearsing.
He’d narrowed it down to seven words:
“Hey, is that To Kill a Mockingbird?”
He would say it casually, like it wasn’t a big deal. Haley always sat near the windows during homeroom, nose buried in something paperback and worn. That morning, it was the same book. Her fingers traced the dog-eared corner like she’d read it more than once.
Ethan adjusted the strap of his backpack. His palms were sweating. He glanced down the hallway—quiet, mostly empty. No Chase. No Tyler. No noise. Just fluorescent lights humming.
Now or never.
He took a deep breath and walked up to her row of lockers.
“Hey,” he said, voice too low. He cleared his throat. “Is that To Kill a Mockingbird?”
Haley looked up, surprised.
For a second—just a second—she smiled.
Then her expression changed. Confused. Uncomfortable.
Behind Ethan, someone made a kissing noise.
“Awwwwww.”
He turned.
Chase and Tyler stood near the corner, leaning casually against the lockers, arms folded, grins already curling.
“Didn’t know you were a romantic, Gray.”
Haley’s cheeks flushed. She shut the book quickly and turned away. “I have to get to class,” she muttered, brushing past Ethan and disappearing into the crowd.
Ethan stood frozen.
Tyler clutched his chest theatrically. “She broke his little Edgar Allen heart.”
Chase pulled out his phone and mimed filming. “Say something sad! Pretend you're gonna write a poem about her hair!”
Ethan walked away, but they followed.
Tyler wasn’t letting up. “Yo, is this your big love story? Beauty and the Beak?”
Laughter echoed down the hallway.
Ethan ducked into the bathroom and locked the stall. He stayed there long after the bell rang.

The shed was darker than usual that afternoon. Gray clouds rolled in early, thickening the sky.
Ethan sat on the upturned milk crate, watching Poe shift on his perch.
“I tried,” he whispered.
The crow blinked slowly.
“She was nice. At least—I thought she was. Or maybe she was just scared of looking like she liked me. I don’t know.”
He picked up a crow feather from the ground and rolled it between his fingers.
“They think they’re clever,” he muttered. “Tyler and Chase. But they’re not. They’re loud. Empty. And everyone acts like that’s normal.”
He didn’t notice his voice rising.
“They follow them like flies on garbage. Laugh at their jokes. Pretend not to see when they trip people or steal stuff. But I see it. I always see it.”
Poe shifted forward, head tilted.
Ethan stared into the crow’s eye. He remembered the article—the one about how crows recognized danger, warned each other, remembered faces.
“I bet you’d remember them,” he said softly. “I bet if they hurt you, you wouldn’t forget.”
Poe didn’t caw. Didn’t move.
Just watched.
Ethan sat in silence for a while.
Then, without really thinking about it, he pulled out his phone and played one of the crow call recordings he’d saved—a sharp, stuttering sound labeled “alarm call.”
Poe flinched and straightened.
Ethan froze.
Outside the shed, another crow cawed—distant but clear.
Then another.
Ethan stepped outside slowly.
Two black shapes wheeled overhead, gliding in slow circles above the yard.
His pulse quickened.
He shut off the sound and looked up at the sky. The clouds had broken slightly. A strip of cold sunlight landed on the rooftop, where one of the crows had perched. It stared down, unmoving.
Poe cawed softly behind him.
Ethan turned and looked back at the shed.
He felt like something had shifted—like a small click inside his mind.
He had failed with Haley. But not entirely. Something had seen it. Something had noticed.
And it hadn’t laughed.
</p>

    <div class="chapter">
      <h2>Chapter Five: The First Feather Falls</h2>
      <p>School let out under a sky the color of steel wool.
Ethan took his time leaving, letting the halls clear. He didn’t want to see Haley. Or Malik. Or anyone. His sketchbook stayed zipped up in his bag, pages still creased from Tyler’s fingers the day before.
He exited through the side doors near the old gym—quiet, overgrown, forgotten. It was the long way home. That’s why he liked it.
Or used to.
“Hey, Crowboy!”
The voice stopped him cold.
Ethan turned.
Tyler and Chase stood near the dumpster beside the maintenance shed, far from teachers, out of sight from the parking lot. Chase was eating a bag of chips. Tyler had that same look—half boredom, half cruelty—that he always wore when he was looking to hurt something.
Ethan didn’t say anything. He adjusted his bag and kept walking.
“You gonna just walk away?” Tyler called. “Come on, give us another line of poetry. Or, I dunno, caw at us.”
Chase chuckled, brushing crumbs off his hoodie.
Ethan stopped at the edge of the lot, gravel crunching beneath his shoes.
He turned.
“You’re not funny,” he said. Voice steady. Cold.
Tyler smirked. “Nah, I’m hilarious. You’re just mad nobody’s laughing with you.”
He walked closer, cracking his knuckles. “So what’s it gonna be? You wanna try that again, like yesterday? Tough guy now?”
Ethan didn’t flinch.
Tyler stepped closer, and Chase circled wide to the side. The classic pincer. Ethan had seen it before.
Then it happened.
A single caw split the air above them—sharp, loud, angry.
Tyler paused, glancing up.
A crow circled above. Then another. Then five.
“Yo… what the hell?” Chase muttered, eyes narrowing.
Ethan’s heart beat hard in his ears. He didn’t speak. He just stood still.
The birds weren’t random. They circled tighter, lower, black shapes against the washed-out sky.
“Okay, that’s weird,” Tyler said, taking a step back. “Is this your… backup?”
That’s when the first crow dove.
Tyler ducked just in time as wings brushed his shoulder and talons clipped his hoodie.
“HEY!” he shouted, stumbling. “What the eff”
Another bird came in, lower, this time hitting square in the chest. He staggered, arms flailing. Chase turned to run, but slipped on the loose gravel and hit the ground hard.
Now the sky was full of black motion.
Students still loitering in the parking lot were turning, pointing.
“Are those crows—?”
“Yo, look at Tyler!”
Someone pulled out a phone.
Another bird hit Tyler’s backpack, tearing the zipper.
“MAKE IT STOP!” he screamed, swinging wildly. One crow caught the back of his head—lightly, but enough to send him shrieking.
Ethan didn’t move. He stood five feet away, untouched, eyes wide.
One crow passed over him—slowed—then veered toward Chase, who was crawling backward into a puddle.
Tyler was on the ground now, covering his face.
The crows didn’t go for blood. They didn’t need to.
They humiliated.
they scared.
They made a show of it.
A teacher ran from the building, yelling. Students gathered at the edge of the lot.
And just as quickly as they’d come, the crows pulled up and scattered into the sky, leaving behind silence.
Tyler sat on the pavement, shaking, a small cut on his temple, his hands covered in dirt. Chase looked like he’d seen a ghost.
All eyes turned to Ethan.
He looked normal. Calm. But no one missed that he hadn’t been touched.
Not once.

That evening, Ethan stood in the doorway of the shed, holding a handful of sunflower seeds.
Poe didn’t caw. Just hopped forward and stared.
“They knew,” Ethan whispered. “They knew who to hit.”
He wasn’t smiling. He wasn’t proud.
He was frightened.
But underneath that was something else. Something colder.
“They remembered him.”
Poe blinked once.
Outside, three more crows perched on the power line above the yard. Silent. Still.
Waiting.
</p>

    <div class="chapter">
      <h2>Chapter Six: They Remember</h2>
      <p>By Monday morning, the video had been shared dozens of times.
It was short—thirty seconds, max—but the story it told stuck: Tyler screaming, crows swooping, Chase on the ground, Ethan untouched. The hallway buzzed with it. Whispers followed him wherever he walked.
“He trained them.”
“I think he feeds them blood.”
Ethan kept his hood up. He didn’t speak unless he had to. Students made space for him now, as if he were contagious. He wasn’t sure if it felt better or worse.

During third period, the intercom crackled.
“Ethan Gray to the front office, please.”
Heads turned. Someone muttered, “Ooooooooh.”
Ethan closed his notebook, stood, and walked out without looking at anyone.

The front office smelled like plastic plants and lemon disinfectant.
Mr. Kessler, the school principal, sat behind his desk. He looked up from a laptop as Ethan entered.
“Have a seat, Ethan.”
He obeyed.
Kessler leaned back with a sigh. His tie was crooked. He looked like he’d rather be doing anything else.
“So,” he said slowly, “there was a… situation on Friday.”
Ethan didn’t reply.
“Two students reported being attacked by birds in the back lot. Several others caught it on video.” He drummed his fingers. “Tyler Mercer’s mother called this morning. She’s… concerned.”
Ethan said, “I didn’t tell the birds to do anything.”
“I didn’t say you did.” Kessler paused. “But you were there. And the birds didn’t attack you. That’s… unusual.”
Ethan shrugged. “I don’t know what to tell you. I feed them sometimes.”
Kessler rubbed his face. “Look, Ethan. I’m not accusing you of anything. But you’ve got a bit of a reputation, and this didn’t help. I just need to know if this is going to be a problem.”
“It wasn’t me,” Ethan said again, firmer this time.
The principal studied him, then sighed.
“All right. Go back to class.”
Ethan stood, but paused at the door.
“They are my friends,” he said without turning around.
Kessler blinked. “What?”
Ethan walked out.

At lunch, Haley sat down across from him outside without asking.
“I saw the video,” she said. “Did you really just stand there the whole time?”
He nodded.
“I heard Tyler’s mom wanted to call the cops.”
“They didn’t,” Ethan said. “Just the principal. He gave me the ‘don’t make this worse’ speech.”
Haley picked at her food. “They’re afraid of you now.”
Ethan didn’t respond.
She looked at him. “Are you afraid of yourself?”
That made him glance up.
“Yeah,” he said.
Then softer: “A little.”

That evening, Ethan returned to the shed. Poe’s wing was almost fully healed now. The bird shifted on his perch, alert, as Ethan entered.
“They’re watching me differently,” Ethan murmured. “Even Haley.”
He pulled out his phone and played one of the crow calls he’d recorded—an alert sound. Outside the shed, there was an answering cry.
He stepped into the fading daylight and looked at the rooftops.
Eight crows sat in a row on the edge of the fence.
None moved. None blinked.
Ethan whispered, “They remember.”
And far above, one crow let out a single, hollow caw—like a bell tolling from the sky.
</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chapter">
      <h2>Chapter Seven: Unkindness Within</h2>
      <p>Ethan walked home in silence.
The wind was still, the trees barely moved, and yet behind him—above him—he could feel them.
He didn’t have to turn around to know.
They were following.
Three, maybe four crows. Quiet. Keeping pace like shadows that had learned to perch.
No one heckled him after school anymore. No gum tossed at his feet. No snide whispers. But it didn’t feel like peace. It felt like the stillness before something ruptures.
Like everyone was holding their breath. Including him.

The shed welcomed him with its musty warmth and half-light.
Poe was awake, perched near the top rail now, stronger every day. He cocked his head the moment Ethan entered, then gave a low caw—short, raspy, but clear.
Ethan gave a weak smile. “Hey.”
He set down his bag and pulled up the little camp stool he'd dragged in weeks ago. His routine had become second nature: check Poe’s wing, freshen the water, toss a few sunflower seeds, sweep out feathers.
But today he didn’t rush. He stayed.
He pulled out his phone and opened a recording labeled “Crow Alert Call #3.” It was the one with a sharp rising tone followed by a long screech—the kind he’d read signaled danger. Or anger. Or warning.
He played it softly. Poe straightened. His eyes locked with Ethan’s.
Then: one wing twitch. A puff of feathers. And Poe cawed back.
Not the same call—something gentler. But it was a response.
Ethan sat forward, heart thumping. “You understood that?”
Poe said nothing. But outside the shed, another crow cawed once in reply.
And another.
Ethan opened the door and stepped into the fading light.
Nine crows.
All perched on the fence line. All watching. Silent.
He looked at them for a long time, then shut the door gently and went back inside.

He pulled out his sketchbook.
But instead of drawing Poe, or wings, or spirals of feathers like usual, Ethan did something different.
He drew himself.
First: a boy with black lines under his eyes, hands in his hoodie pocket, surrounded by birds on a wire.
Second: the same boy, but the birds were landing on his arms, shoulders, even his head. His eyes were hollow in this one.
Last: a silhouette made entirely of birds, mid-scream, the human shape inside nearly invisible.
He stared at the page.
“They didn’t need my voice. They needed my pain.”
He closed the sketchbook. His fingers shook a little.
He didn’t know if he was proud of what happened to Tyler… or just relieved. Maybe both. Maybe neither.
“They’re becoming more like me,” he whispered. “Or maybe I’m becoming more like them.”
He stood up and looked at Poe, who blinked slowly.
“You didn’t ask for this,” Ethan said.
The bird ruffled his feathers, then hopped once—closer.
“You just showed up. And I gave you shelter.”
He reached out a hand, slowly, and Poe stepped forward onto his wrist. Light. Deliberate. The contact sent a chill down Ethan’s arm that had nothing to do with cold.
He held the bird up to eye level.
“Am I using you?” he asked quietly. “Or are you using me?”
Poe tilted his head.
No answer.

Later, after night had fallen and the yard was dark, Ethan stepped outside one more time.
Just to breathe.
The shed creaked as it settled in the cold. The wind was still again. No cars passed.
And there they were.
The crows.
More than before.
On the fence, on the roof, on the line running from the house to the pole. Maybe twenty.
Just watching.
He didn’t call them.
He hadn’t whistled. He hadn’t played a recording.
He hadn’t even thought about them.
Not out loud.
He stepped back.
“I didn’t ask for this,” he said again.
From the tree overhead, one crow gave a low call—soft and deliberate.
Ethan shivered.
Because the sound wasn’t angry.
It sounded like agreement.

      <h2>Chapter Eight: Shadow in the Sky</h2>
      <p>Ethan first saw the girl standing outside the fence, just beyond the edge of the yard.
She wore a beanie, oversized glasses, and held a camera rig like it was part of her arm. She was smiling.
Not a creepy smile—friendly, like she wanted to borrow sugar or talk about anime.
He didn’t wave back.
“Hi!” she called. “I’m not here to bother you! Just… wondering if I could talk to you for a second?”
Ethan hesitated at the shed door. Poe stirred behind him.
“I’m Sophie. I run a channel—kind of like a local weird news vlog. Cryptid stuff, urban legends, that kind of thing. You’re not a cryptid, by the way,” she laughed. “You’re just interesting. You’ve got fans.”
“I don’t want to be interesting,” Ethan said.
“I get that,” Sophie replied, lowering the camera a little. “Honestly, I’m not trying to stir anything. Just thought maybe you’d like to say your side before someone else runs with it.”
That gave Ethan pause.
He knew what happened last week was spreading. He’d seen a clip online with the title “Crowboy Strikes Back”. Most of the comments were jokes.
Some weren’t.
He stepped forward, keeping a few feet between them. “No video.”
“Fair.” She lowered the camera. “Just audio?”
He nodded. Warily.
She hit record on her mic. “Okay. Off the record, even.”
She asked simple questions at first:
•	How long had he been feeding crows?
•	What was the injured one’s name?
•	Did he ever feel like they understood him?
Ethan, quiet at first, slowly opened up. He talked about Poe, about the shed, about learning their calls. He even smiled once, just barely.
Then something changed in her tone.
“You ever tell them to go after people?” she asked casually.
Ethan blinked. “No.”
“But they attacked a kid at school, right? Just one. And they left you alone.”
“I didn’t tell them to do that.”
“Sure, but maybe they just picked up on your anger?” she pressed. “Like… you didn’t say it, but you wanted it. That counts, doesn’t it?”
Ethan tensed. “That’s not what this is.”
Sophie kept her smile, but her voice turned just sharp enough.
“So if more people got hurt—if this happened again—you’d take responsibility?”
Ethan narrowed his eyes. “What are you trying to do?”
“I’m just asking questions,” she said lightly. “The public’s curious. They think you're either a victim… or something darker.”
From the trees behind the fence, a crow cawed. Loud. Warning.
Sophie flinched. “That yours?”
“I don’t own them,” Ethan said. But his voice had gone flat.
More caws joined in—one, then two, then five.
Sophie turned and looked behind her.
The power lines had filled with crows.
Dozens.
Watching.
Silent.
She backed up a step, then fumbled for her camera. “Okay, okay… maybe that’s enough for today.”
A crow swooped low, just over her head.
She ducked. “Jesus!”
“I didn’t call them,” Ethan said.
Another bird dropped to the fence, wings spread.
Then another.
Sophie clutched her mic. “You’re not in control, are you?”
Ethan didn’t answer.
She backed off, walking quickly toward the sidewalk, heart pounding, trying to look unshaken.
One crow followed her.
Then two.
Then seven.
She broke into a jog.

That night, the clip went viral.
Not on her main page—she didn’t post it. But someone filmed her leaving Ethan’s house and getting chased down the street by a flock of birds.
The caption read:
“Crowboy Has a Murder. Literally.”
The birds aren’t just protecting him now. They’re warning the rest of us.

Inside the shed, Poe perched silently on Ethan’s arm.
Ethan stared at the closed door.
“I didn’t want this,” he said softly. “I just wanted them to stop harassing me.”
Outside, the crows called again.
This time, it sounded almost like laughter.
</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chapter">
      <h2>Chapter Nine: The Whispers</h2>
      <p>The morning after the video spread like wildfire, Ethan woke to a neighborhood transformed.
Whispers floated behind closed doors. Windows shut tight when he passed. On the side of the shed, someone had sprayed black graffiti: “Bird Freak” — sharp and jagged, like claws scratching wood.
He stared at the hateful words, but his fingers itched toward the door, where Poe waited silently on his perch.

Inside, Poe cawed softly, watching Ethan move. Ethan picked up the phone, flipping through recordings of crow calls he'd made over the last weeks.
With cautious fingers, he played a sharp, rising call — the signal for danger.
Outside the window, a dozen crows answered in chorus, filling the sky with a dark chorus.
His heart thudded. The connection was no longer just about feeding or safety. It was power — but he didn’t know how to control it.

Later that afternoon, Haley came by, walking up the cracked driveway without hesitation.
She stopped just inside the gate, hands stuffed deep in her jacket pockets.
“I saw the graffiti,” she said quietly. “It’s awful.”
Ethan shrugged, trying to look indifferent.
She crouched near Poe’s cage, meeting the bird’s black eyes.
“Hey, Poe,” she said softly. “You’re not so scary.”
Ethan watched her, surprised by how calm she seemed.
“Do you think they love you?” Haley asked, glancing up.
Ethan frowned. “I don’t know. Sometimes it feels like they need me more.”
Haley nodded slowly. “That’s different.”
They sat side by side in silence, watching Poe preen.

That evening, Ethan stepped outside again, phone in hand.
He played a gentler call — the feeding call.
From the fence, a single crow flew in to land on the shed roof.
Ethan’s breath caught when Poe took flight from his perch and joined it.
Together, the two birds circled once, then twice, before landing beside Ethan.
He extended a finger, and Poe hopped onto it.
A shiver ran through Ethan — part awe, part fear.
He whispered, “I don’t know where this is going.”
But the crows around him seemed to answer.
Not in words, but in presence.
</p>

    <div class="chapter">
      <h2>Chapter Ten: Things That Shouldn’t Speak</h2>
      <p>Ethan knew something was off the moment he walked through the front door.
The house was too quiet. No radio playing in the kitchen, no TV muttering from the living room. Just the soft, unsteady hum of the refrigerator.
His father sat at the kitchen table, hunched over his phone. The screen’s glow lit his face from below, casting deep shadows across his jaw.
Ethan paused in the doorway.
His father didn’t look up. “You see this?”
Ethan didn’t answer.
“You see what people are saying about you?” he asked again, louder.
Ethan stepped in slowly. “It’s just a stupid video.”
His father’s fist slammed the table hard enough to rattle the salt shaker.
“Stupid? The whole damn town thinks you’re possessed, Ethan. They think you’re some freak who controls animals with your mind.”
“I never said that.”
“You didn’t have to!” he snapped. “You sit out there with those birds every damn day like a ghost child in a horror movie. You think people aren’t gonna talk?”
Ethan clenched his fists. “They’re just animals. I take care of them.”
His father finally looked up, eyes bloodshot, jaw tight. “They’re not just animals anymore, and you know it.”
Silence stretched between them.
Then, quieter, colder:
“You’re not right, Ethan. Never have been.”
Ethan felt that line hit him in the chest like a stone.
The birds had never made him feel broken. The people had. Now his father too.
“I didn’t ask to be like this,” Ethan muttered. “You think I enjoy people being scared of me?”
His father stood. He wasn’t tall, but he had that tired kind of fury that made him seem bigger than he was.
“You’re going to stop feeding them. You hear me? No more birds. No more shed. No more hiding.”
Ethan stared at him, unblinking. “You can’t make me.”
“I can tear that damn thing down with my own two hands,” his father growled. “And if you step out of line again, I will.”
He walked past Ethan, grabbing his keys off the counter, and left without another word. The door slammed hard enough to shake the floor.

That night, Ethan sat in the shed, lights dim, Poe nestled quietly on his perch.
Ethan didn’t cry. He’d done that enough over the years to know when it wasn’t worth it.
Instead, he stared at the far wall, heart numb and mind racing.
Was it worth it?
The crows had given him resolve—but at what cost?
He closed his eyes and listened to the faint rustling outside. A flutter. A small thud.
When he opened the shed door, the night was heavy with fog. A single crow stood at the threshold.
At its feet was a smooth gray rock.
Tied around it with frayed twine was something Ethan recognized immediately:
A torn piece of his father’s broken watch band.
Ethan picked it up slowly.
No blood. No feathers. Just the message.
He looked up.
Twelve crows stared down from the fence line.
They didn’t blink.
He whispered into the darkness:
“I didn’t ask for this.”
One of the crows let out a low, deliberate caw.
And something in Ethan’s stomach turned cold.
</p>
    </div>
<div class="chapter">
      <h2>Chapter Eleven: The Empty Perch</h2>
      <p> School was quiet. Too quiet.
The kind of quiet that meant everyone had already seen the video. Already read the latest round of comments.
Some people didn’t look at Ethan at all. Others did, too long, like he might bite.
In second period, someone whispered the word “crowboy” behind his back and snorted. He didn’t turn around. Didn’t need to.
Even Haley was distant. Not cruel—but watchful. Like she wasn’t sure if she wanted to be associated with this attention.
At lunch, he sat outside alone. Usually a few birds would watch from nearby rooftops or trees. But not today.
Not one.
He felt it in his bones—an absence, like missing a heartbeat you didn’t realize was always there.
He left early without telling anyone. His stomach twisted the whole walk home.
He turned the corner onto his block and froze.
A white Animal Control van was parked at the curb.
Two uniformed workers were walking toward the backyard.
One held a long pole with a looped net at the end. The other carried a thick black crate.
His father stood on the porch, arms crossed.
Ethan dropped his bag and ran.
“What are you doing?” he shouted. “Stop!”
The animal control workers turned. One of them, a tall woman with gray hair, held up a hand. “You need to stay back, kid.”
“That’s my bird!” Ethan yelled. “He’s not wild. He’s mine!”
“He’s a crow,” she said flatly. “Technically wildlife. And after what’s been going around online, we got reports from several concerned neighbors. We’re here to remove him—humanely.”
Ethan turned to his father.
“You called them?”
His father didn’t answer at first.
Then: “You left me no choice. You’ve made this whole family a target. I’m doing what I should’ve done weeks ago.”
“He’s not dangerous,” Ethan snapped.
“He’s not natural,” his father shot back. “None of this is.”
From inside the shed came a single, sharp caw.
Ethan shoved past one of the workers before anyone could stop him and threw open the door.
Poe flapped wildly, hopping to the edge of his perch, eyes wide and wings half-spread.
“It’s okay,” Ethan whispered, stepping inside. “I’m here. I’m right here.”
But behind him, a net swung in.
Poe tried to dodge—screeching, flapping, feathers flying—but he was caught.
The loop tightened.
Ethan shouted, reaching out, but someone grabbed him by the shoulders and dragged him back.
Poe screamed.
Not like a bird—like a cry for help.
They shoved him into the crate and slammed the lid.
The sound cut off instantly.
Ethan stood frozen, fists clenched so tight his knuckles ached.
One of the workers locked the van door. The other muttered, “That was easier than I thought it’d be.”
They didn’t hear the rustling in the trees. Or see the black shapes gathering on the power lines.
But Ethan did.
And they weren’t going to stay quiet for long.
</p>
    </div>
<div class="chapter">
      <h2>Chapter Twelve:  The Wing </h2>
      <p> Ethan crouched in the narrow alley behind the county animal control building, his heart pounding.
The chain-link gate creaked as he slipped through. He kept his head down, hoodie up, the late afternoon sun casting long orange slants across the concrete.
He moved quickly, like he’d done this before, though his hands trembled.
He hadn’t told anyone.
No note to his mom. No text to Haley.
No signal to the crows.
But somehow… he knew they were already watching.

He crept through the rear employee entrance as an older man exited with a cigarette in his mouth and earbuds in. The door clicked behind Ethan, but he was inside.
Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead. He passed kennels filled with barking dogs and whining cats.
Then—another hallway. A sign:
“Wildlife Holding – Staff Only.”
He pushed through the door—
And stopped.
A uniformed worker was standing by a counter, flipping through a clipboard. Stocky, early thirties, with a long ponytail and thick black gloves.
The man looked up, startled. “What the—? Hey! You’re not supposed to be back here!”
Ethan froze. “I just need my bird—he’s mine—he’s not wild—”
“I know who you are,” the man said, stepping forward. “You’re the crow kid from that video. You can’t be here. You need to leave—now.”
Ethan looked past him. There. The cage near the back.
Poe.
The worker pulled out his phone, already tapping the screen.
“Yeah, dispatch? I’ve got a situation—kid broke into the holding wing—yeah, that kid. The crow one. Send police, now.”
Ethan sprinted past him.

Poe was thrashing in his cage, wings slapping the metal bars, calling out sharp and shrill.
“Easy! I’m here!” Ethan gasped, throwing open the simple sliding latch.
The door popped open and Poe exploded into the air, winging around the cramped space once before soaring through the rear fire exit Ethan had shoved open.
The worker shouted behind him, “Get back here!”
But Ethan was already running.

He burst out into the late-day light—and skidded to a stop.
Three squad cars blocked the lot.
Lights flashed.
Five officers stood with hands near their holsters. One was already speaking into a radio. Another had his baton drawn.
“Freeze!” someone barked. “Hands in the air!”
Poe circled once above Ethan—just long enough to meet his eyes—then shot toward the trees, where a wave of black shapes had begun to rise.
The crows were already coming.

A voice yelled: “Get on the ground, now!”
Ethan didn’t move. He couldn’t.
From behind the lot, the sky turned black.
One crow.
Then ten.
Then fourty.
They dove in like a swarm, screeching.
Wings clapped like thunder. Feathers filled the air.
“Get back! Get back!” an officer shouted, swatting at his head.
One crow landed on the roof of a squad car and knocking its beak against the windshield aggressively.
Another dove at a baton hand and tore open the knuckles of a police officer with its talons.
An officer fell. Another fired once into the air—BANG.
A crow dropped.
Then another shot—this one struck a bird mid-flight.
Feathers exploded in a puff of black.
Ethan shouted, “Stop! Please, stop!”
But the crows didn’t stop.
And neither did the officers.
They ducked behind doors, swinging batons, yelling into radios.
Another gun fired. The crows shrieked louder.
They weren’t just attacking.
They were defending.

Ethan dropped to his knees, hands behind his head, before they forced him down.
An officer knelt on his back and cuffed him roughly. “You’re under arrest. Trespassing. Interference. Theft.”
“They were going to kill him,” Ethan gasped. “You don’t understand—”
“We don’t care!” the officer growled. “You’ve got five cops under attack by birds right now, kid. This isn’t about a pet.”
Another crow hit the cruiser’s rearview mirror and snapped it clean off.

As Ethan was shoved into the back seat of a squad car, he saw Poe perched on the animal control building’s roof.
Still watching.
Feathers ruffled.
Eyes gleaming.
And then he flew.
Up, out, away—joining the storm of wings still filling the sky.

From behind the cruiser’s mesh glass, Ethan didn’t cry.
He just sat still. Eyes wide.
Mouth closed.
Heart racing with something that wasn’t fear.
Not anymore.
</p>

<div class="chapter">
      <h2>Chapter Thirteen: The Cage </h2>
      <p> The first night in holding was the hardest.
The cell was sterile and humming with quiet misery — one steel cot bolted to the wall, a thin gray blanket, and a light overhead that never quite turned off. The hum of the hallway — footsteps, clanging doors, murmured voices — made it hard to tell if time was moving or standing still.
Ethan didn’t sleep much. He lay on the cot, hands clasped on his chest, staring at the ceiling and thinking of feathers. The sound of wings. The look Poe had given him before flying off into the trees.
It hadn’t felt like goodbye.
Not exactly.
But it hadn’t felt like a promise either.

They moved him to the county juvenile holding facility the next morning — same silence, new walls. The guards didn’t say much, and the other kids didn’t ask questions.
He was “the crow kid.”
The one on the news.
Some looked at him like he was dangerous. Others like he was pathetic.
He didn’t care. He just kept his head down.

A counselor came by. A young woman with a clipboard and soothing voice who asked if he had ever hurt himself or others. If he thought the birds were speaking to him. If he had "delusions of control."
Ethan told her, “I didn’t train them.”
She nodded like she was pretending to understand.
But she didn’t.
No one did.

Later, a tired public defender with coffee breath explained that the charges were serious, but he wouldn’t be tried as an adult. Trespassing. Breaking and entering. Petty theft. Possible endangerment.
She told him the media was circling the story like vultures. “The public’s interested,” she said. “And scared. Birds aren’t supposed to do that.”
Ethan just stared at the wall. “People aren’t supposed to shoot them either.”

On the second evening, just before lights out, a guard opened the door and nodded.
“You’ve got a visitor.”
Ethan’s heart jumped.

He followed the guard down a hall to the visitation area, where thick glass divided each booth. He expected his mom. Maybe his public defender again.
But when he stepped into the room and saw Haley sitting there in the opposite chair, he froze.
She smiled. Not big. Not fake. Just enough.
He sat slowly, picked up the phone.
She did too.
“Hi,” she said.
“I didn’t think anyone would come,” Ethan said softly.
“I had to beg my mom. Told her you weren’t dangerous. That you were my friend.” Haley paused. “Still am, if you want.”
Ethan looked down, embarrassed. “They think I made them do it. The birds.”
“Did you?”
“No.”
She nodded. “I didn’t think so.”
They were quiet for a moment.
Then she leaned forward, eyes searching his.
“Are you okay?”
He wanted to say yes. Wanted to lie. But his voice cracked when he tried.
“I miss him,” he whispered. “I miss all of them.”
“I know,” she said gently.
“I don’t even know where Poe is now.”
“I think…” Haley hesitated. “I think he’s not far.”
Ethan met her eyes.
“You’re not alone, Ethan. Even if it feels like it right now.”
The guard knocked on the glass, signaling the time was up.
Haley stood slowly and mouthed two words through the glass:
“Hold on.”
And Ethan did.
He held on to that look in her eyes, and the memory of the birds that hadn’t left him.
Not yet.
</p>
    </div>

<div class="chapter">
      <h2>Chapter Fourteen: To The Farm</h2>
      <p> The metal door buzzed open, and Ethan squinted into the light.
A guard waved him forward without a word. His shoes thudded softly against the linoleum. No one said “good luck” or “take care.” They just handed him a plastic bag with his hoodie, wallet, and a few crumpled papers. No phone. That had been kept as evidence.
At the front desk, he spotted a familiar figure leaning against the wall.
His father.
Wearing a flannel shirt, unshaven, jaw clenched.
For a second, Ethan thought maybe he wouldn’t say anything at all.
But when the paperwork was signed and the two stepped outside into the weak afternoon sun, his father finally spoke.
“Get in the truck.”

The ride home was quiet. Radio off. Wind through a cracked window.
Ethan watched the scenery blur past—gas stations, traffic lights, the edge of town—and felt like he was seeing everything for the last time.
Halfway home, his father cleared his throat.
“You’re not going back to school.”
Ethan turned his head. “What?”
“You’re not staying here either.”
Silence.
Then his father continued, not looking at him. “Talked to your grandfather. You're going to the farm. It’s settled. Somewhere quiet, far from all this mess. You’ll finish the year online. Help out around the property.”
“You’re sending me away,” Ethan muttered.
His father’s jaw tightened. “You need space. Time. And people aren’t exactly thrilled about you being here right now.”
Ethan stared at the dashboard.
“This isn't punishment,” his father added. “It's protection. For everyone.”
“You mean for you,” Ethan said, voice low. “So you don’t have to deal with me.”
His father smacked his palm against the steering wheel, making Ethan flinch.
“Don’t twist this. You brought crows down on cops, Ethan. You think I don’t want to believe you didn’t mean to? That it was all just instinct or… whatever? But none of that matters anymore. People are scared. And they’re watching us.”
The truck rattled into their neighborhood. The same one where Ethan had first found Poe injured on the side of the road. The same street where the kids used to yell slurs from their bikes and Haley once handed him a notebook when she thought no one was looking.
And just like that, he was being removed from it all. Uprooted. Displaced.
Like a stray.

That night, Ethan packed quietly.
The shed out back was empty now, the perch bare, the air stale. He stood inside one last time, staring at the wall where Poe used to sleep.
Something told him not to say goodbye.
Something told him they’d meet again.
Maybe it was just hope.
Or maybe it was something older. Something instinctive.
Like the part of him that knew when he was being watched.

The next morning, just after sunrise, the truck rolled out of the driveway.
The duffel bag at his feet was full of clothes and notebooks.
But Ethan carried something heavier: the sense that whatever this thing was—this connection between him and the birds—it wasn’t finished.
It had just gone quiet.
Like the pause between wingbeats.
</p>
    </div>

<div class="chapter">
      <h2>Chapter Fifteen: That Feather </h2>
      <p> The road to the farm curved like a lazy snake through dry hills and fields scattered with brush and winter trees. The truck bounced as it left the pavement and hit gravel, dust kicking up behind them in long, winding plumes.
Ethan sat in silence, watching the world flatten out around them. No strip malls. No sirens. No school. No fences scribbled with insults. Just open space and fences built to keep animals in—not people out.
His grandfather met them at the gate, tall and wiry, gray hair tucked under an old cap. He didn’t say much. Just gave Ethan a nod and took his bags from the truck.
“Room’s upstairs. We get up early,” he said.
And that was that.

The house smelled like cedar and something older. There were deer heads on the wall and a cross by the door. A wide porch overlooked miles of pasture, and the shed out back had rust on the roof and ivy creeping up the walls.
Ethan spent the first day helping with firewood and sweeping out the barn. No one asked about the crows. No one mentioned the arrest. It was like the outside world had been left behind at the county line.
He slept deeply that night—no buzzing lights, no slamming doors. Just the creak of the old house and the whistle of wind through trees.

On the second morning, Ethan woke before the sun.
He dressed quietly and stepped outside, boots crunching on the frosty grass. The air was sharp and clean, and mist clung low to the field.
He wandered toward the old fence line, drawn by something he couldn’t name.
Something that felt familiar.

A single crow sat on the fence.
It was larger than most. Still. Silent.
And from its right wing, a single silver feather shimmered faintly in the dawn light.
Ethan stopped.
“Could it be the same one”
The crow tilted its head.
Watching.
Not moving.
Not calling.
Just there.
Ethan slowly lowered himself to the grass and sat cross-legged, facing the bird.
He didn’t speak.
He didn’t have to.
The air between them felt like recognition. Like something understood without being said. A story still unfinished.
The crow blinked.
And then, without a sound, it took flight—wings slicing the air like a whisper—and vanished into the trees beyond the field.
Ethan remained still for a long time.
His breath fogged in the morning light.
The space on the fence where the crow had perched was now empty.
But inside him, something stirred.
Not fear. Not grief.
Readiness.
